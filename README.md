# ðŸŒŒ Galaxy Matching Game
Galaxy Matching Game is a web-based
game that features a 12-card layout with a simple goal: flip the
cards and find all the matching pairs with the lowest amount of flips.
This project was completed as part of an academic assignment using JavaScript\
and features galactic-themed visuals created by me.

Check out the game [here](https://ssevilla23.github.io/Galaxy-Matching-Game/)!
